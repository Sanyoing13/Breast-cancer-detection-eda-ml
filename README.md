# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning


## 📝 Project Description

This project focuses on **early detection of breast cancer** using **supervised machine learning** techniques. By leveraging the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset available in `sklearn.datasets`, it applies **robust exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **builds multiple classification models** to **predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign** based on medical imaging **features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, and concavity.**

The aim is to demonstrate a complete machine learning pipeline—from data understanding to model evaluation—while highlighting performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This helps build a strong foundation for **AI-powered medical diagnostics** that can potentially **assist healthcare professionals** in making informed decisions.
